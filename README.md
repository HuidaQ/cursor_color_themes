# Cursor Fusion Themes

Two dark themes built by fusing **editing** colors from *Tokyo Gray Storm* with **static background** colors from either *Nord Deep* or *Catppuccin Frappe*.

## Included Themes
- **Nord Deep × Tokyo Gray Storm — Fusion (Editing-first)**
- **Catppuccin Frappe × Tokyo Gray Storm — Fusion (Editing-first)**

### Rules used
- *Editing-related* colors (foregrounds, selections, current line, cursor/ghost/placeholder/inlay/search matches, token colors) come from **Tokyo Gray Storm**.
- *Only static backgrounds* (workbench/editor/sidebar/panels/bars backgrounds) come from either **Nord Deep** or **Catppuccin Frappe**, depending on the theme.
- In places with low contrast, prefer the higher-contrast option.
